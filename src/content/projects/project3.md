This full stack web application combines Astro for static site generation, Svelte for dynamic frontend components, and
C# on the backend. Itâ€™s designed to be fast, modern, and developer-friendly. The project demonstrates smooth integration
across technologies and a clean separation of concerns between front and back end.
